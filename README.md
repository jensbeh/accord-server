# Accord Server

The Accord server is a Java server developed with Spring Boot and a MySQL server that serves as the backend server for the app [Accord](https://github.com/jensbeh/accord-client).

**Note:** This server was specially developed for Windows!


## Requirements

To run the server, you must meet the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and configured


## Installation

1. Download the latest version/release of the server from this [link](https://github.com/jensbeh/accord-server/releases).
2. Unzip the server ".jar" file and wait for the server to install. **Note:** This requires an internet connection, as the server downloads the MySQL server from the internet.
3. The server is started as soon as this appears in the server window.
4. For each further start, you only have to start the server ".jar" file and wait a short time.


## Usage

The server provides various endpoints for communication with the app [Accord](https://github.com/jensbeh/accord-client). You can use the endpoints to register/login users, send direct messages, create servers and perform many other actions.

**Note:** This server was developed specifically for the app [Accord](https://github.com/jensbeh/accord-client) and is not intended for general use!
